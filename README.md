Project Title: Sales Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

Summary:
This project focuses on analyzing monthly sales data to derive actionable insights and build predictive models for order quantities. Key steps include data merging, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning model implementation. The objective is to uncover sales patterns, identify peak months and top-performing cities, and predict future order quantities. Skills utilized include data wrangling, EDA, machine learning (linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting), and data visualization.

Key Features:

Merged monthly sales files into a single DataFrame for streamlined analysis.
Conducted data cleaning to address null values and ensure data accuracy.
Utilized EDA to identify peak sales months and top-selling cities.
Implemented machine learning models (linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting) to predict order quantities.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared score.
Empowered users to make data-driven decisions and enhance sales strategies.
Usage:
This project is valuable for anyone interested in sales data analysis, predictive modeling, or business strategy. It provides insights into sales trends, helps identify areas for improvement, and offers predictive capabilities for future sales forecasting. Users can leverage the codebase, methodologies, and insights to enhance their own sales strategies and decision-making processes.
